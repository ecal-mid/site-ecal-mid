Website for the Media &amp; Interaction Design major at ECAL / University of Arts and Design Lausanne

## About
The idea is to create an index of web-based projects first and foremost.

However a V2 could consist of a platform gathering projects, resources (snippets, interviews, ...) and also an Alumni yearbook (sort of ?) with a profile for each of them. This would make the website not only valuable for our communication but also for our (prospective) students as well.
